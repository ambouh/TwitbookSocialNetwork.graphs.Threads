## **CREATING A SOCIAL NETWORK PROGRAM (TWITBOOK) - USING GRAPHS, MAPS, THREADS**

##### CONCEPTS:
[Object Oriented Design, Graphs, Maps, Threads, HTML, Unit Testing Development]

##### PURPOSE:
- *Object Oriented Design*: To apply graph and map concepts to real-world scenario by programming a social network. A Graph is utilized to create the network of individuals; outlined by a hashmap (vertex, hashmap) where a person (vertex - key) and friends represented by (hashmap). each individual holds a hashmap as friends they've added to their network (list of neighboring vertices). 

- *Graphs, Maps*: to represent a directed graph containing vertices and weighted edges. Utilizing hashMap to represent a graph strucuture. 

- *Threads*: to implement threads to add users. it "lock" or synchronizes a user adding a friend until the transaction is complete. then, release "lock".

- *HTML*: An html page has all the networking data which is parsed in order to add members to the social network graph.

### COURSE: Program Design and Data Structures
